DAILY EXPENSES v0.0.2

Author: Dan Kronstal

Purpose: After some time travelling with my wife, and using 
the "notebook" application in the iPod to keep track of our
daily expenses, I decided to try writing an Android application
for this task.  This is my first Android application, and as
such likely falls victim to many faults.

This application has been developed using the MOTODEV Eclipse
environment (http://developer.motorola.com/docstools/motodevstudio/download/), 
and uses the GraphView library (https://github.com/jjoe64/GraphView).

Fine Print: No warranty is offered or implied. This is a 
personal project. Do not use it.
